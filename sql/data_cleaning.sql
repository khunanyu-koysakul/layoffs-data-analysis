-- now if we check those are all null

SELECT *

UPDATE layoffs_staging2 t1

SELECT *

-- we can use str to date to update this field
UPDATE layoffs_staging2

-- now we can convert the data type properly

-- 3. Handle missing values

-- The null values look fine, so I won’t change them — keeping them helps during EDA calculations.


-- 4. Delete unnecessary columns or rows
